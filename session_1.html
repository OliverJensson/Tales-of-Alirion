                <h1>Attack on Aliriondorn.</h1>
                <p><br>
                    The busy inhabitants of the great city of Aliriondorn have been disrturbed by a surprise and unexpected full scale attack on their city. <br><br>
                    As if this was not strange enough, the attackers seem to be interested only on one particular location of the city. 
                    Ones inside the walls, they ingored averything and headed directly for the main square.<br><br> Far from the action, two of our heroes lie imprisoned in the dungeons of the city barracks. 
                    Alerted by sudden explosion sounds, they had to find a way out of their stone cells. The danger was not only on the streets, A team of wizards teleported in the dungeons and started kidnapping all the prisoners they could find. 
                    At the last minute, our heroes were able to ascape from an opening that an explosion caused on the roof of their cell.<br><br>
                    Inside the library, the wizards and their pupils were preparing to protect the precius information held inside the city hall. Our noble mage hero was assigned the heavy duty to lead the pupils and prepare them for an eventual battle.
                    When all seem lost, the attacking army withdrowned. Soldiers start fleeing, other just disappear on the spot. Silence fell on the city. But there was no time to spare, the Archmage had a message to deliver. 
                    This message was not an ordinary one, and should not be intersepted by the enemy. <br><br>
                    It should be delivered in person. Thus, the Archamge assigned a quest of major importance to our noble mage hero: 
                    Find two specific individuals, hidding somewere in the city, and head to the Holy Library and deliver a parchment.<br><br>
                    All our heroes finally managed to meet, and thus agreed to go to this adventure together, each one for the own reasons. <br><br>
                    They headed to the sewage, since this way they would be able to leave the city without being spotted.<br>
                    After a couple of aggressive encounters, from which they exited victorious, the small party of adventures reached the limits of the city and headed to the forest, home of the namless druid. <br><br>
                    There, they rested, ingoring the dangers they were heading to, dreaming of long lost treasures, and pawerfull encient artifacts.
